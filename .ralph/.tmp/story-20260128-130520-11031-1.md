### US-001: Expand Integration Tests
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want the integration tests to run all examples in /docs/examples so that I have full coverage.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update ralph/tests/integration/examples_test.go
- [ ] Dynamically list all .singlish files in ../../docs/examples
- [ ] Run each file using the singlish binary
- [ ] Assert that the command exits with code 0
- [ ] Pass: Test discovers and runs all examples (even if some fail)
